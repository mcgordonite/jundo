# 純度 (purity)

An experiment with functional programming and 3D graphics using [PureScript](http://www.purescript.org/) and WebGL.

## Building

This project is built using PureScript (version 0.7.4.1) and the pulp build tool (version 4.4.0):

	npm install -g pulp

Then a development server can be started using:

	pulp server

## Disclaimer

This is my first purely functional project, and my first experiment with WebGL. It probably doesn't reflect best practices!
